These are instruction for building the "kif version" of Vampire under Linux, 
for use with the Sigma Knowledge Engineering Environment. 

PRELIMINARIES: You may need gcc 2.95.3. Other documentation on Vampire claims 
that this compiler is  necessary. It's what I used and it is believable that 
this version is necessary, because there are so many warnings generated during 
the compilation. 

When I compiled gcc, I used the configuration:   
  --prefix=/local --enable-threads --enable-languages=c++
If you have success with other versions of gcc, drop us a note at   
sigmakee-develop at lists.sourceforge.net.

TO BUILD:

1) edit the makefile in this directory and set CC to the path where you installed gcc 2.95.3
2) make 

Expect lots of errors, but expect it to produce and executable ./vampire

3) Set the following variable in the Sigma configuration to point to this executable
and directory. I built vampire in /local/sigma/current/Vampire, so I use:

<preference key="inferenceEngine" value="/local/sigma/current/Vampire/vampire"/>
<preference key="inferenceEngineDir" value="/local/sigma/current/Vampire/"/>

4) chmod 777 /local/sigma/current/Vampire/


n.b. Intermixed with Vampire files "proper" are files from the ANTLR-2.6.0 distribution.
This is the way Vampire is distributed. It isn't something particular to what
we are doing with Sigma. The antlr subdirectory of this directory is the same collection 
of files found in the antlr subdirectory of antlr-2.6.0. 

Note also that this distribution contains 12 files generated by ANTLR-2.6.0 
(the files {KIF,XML}*.{cpp,hpp,txt}). The parts of the makefile that create these
files have not been tested, and 'make clean' doesn't remove them.
